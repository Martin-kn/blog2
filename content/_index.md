I am currently carrying out a project that consists of having my own servers both for personal use and for testing, networking and security. And in the future I will apply the acquired programming knowledge to be able to create web applications that provide information or automate day-to-day tasks


In my free time I like to train in cybersecurity, I Play CTF's in HackTheBox and TryHackMe 


TryHackMe profile:
